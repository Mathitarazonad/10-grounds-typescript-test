# 10 Grounds Technical TypeScript Test
This is a technical test made with TypeScript for 10 Grounds.


## The test

### What to do?
The test is to write a simulation algorithm.

### How to do it?
Use the technology discussed in the interview for creating the solution.

### Problem?

- In a University, there is a classroom, in that classroom, there are 4 fluorescent tube units, each
unit contains 4 fluorescent tubes.
- The classroom is used 15 hours a day, 5 times a week, 9 months a year.
- Every fluorescent tube works for a fixed amount of hours, that amount is returned by a function
called "rand()" that returns an integer number from 100 to 200 that represents the number of
hours that the fluorescent tube will work before breaking.
- Once 2 fluorescent tubes fail in a single unit, you should replace all 4 tubes.
- Each fluorescent tube costs 7 U$D.

The algorithm should print:
1. How many fluorescent tubes were broken in 1 year in that classroom?
2. How much money do fluorescent tubes cost the University per year per classroom?

## Run the Test

As a test that is made with TypeScript, you should follow some steps to run this test:
